# ebaydata
This project:
- scrapes sales data from eBay,
- uses the eBay API to enrich the data set to 20+ fields 
- cleans the data and matches fields to existing tables (this is quite involved as there are many free-form human input fields)
- performs a few analyses

I made this as part of a job application in early 2021. It has not been made squeaky clean for public use, and likely needs to be updated because of changes to eBay.
